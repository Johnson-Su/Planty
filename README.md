# Planty
Planty is a chrome extension that is easy to access and intuitive to use while still giving enough functionality to the user for its purpose to be achieved. Users can open the chrome extension while browsing different recipes. Planty will then identify and display all the food items which produce high carbon emissions, suggest alternatives and calculate the total carbon impact of the recipe with any alternative foods that are selected. This helps users become more environmentally conscious of their carbon footprint and provides resources to help them lower it.

## How to use
Click the Chrome menu icon and select Extensions from the Tools menu. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked. Now you can reload extensions, load an unpacked directory of files as if it were a packaged extension, and more.
